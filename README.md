# CLox
Another implementation of ByteCode Interpreter for Lox in C, with tons of new features.


## Introduction
CLox is an implementation of the programming language Lox in C. Currently it uses naive single-pass compiler, and only runtime optimization is performed. In future it is planned to have a multi-pass compiler with AST and compiler optimization. The initial version of CLox has only features already present in the original Lox reference implementation, but subsequent versions will continue to add new features to make it a powerful language. This is an experiment on the design and implementation of language features, before I start to implement the backend of my own programming language Mysidia. Stay tuned. 

The original version of Lox programming language can be found at Bob Nystrom's repository:

## Features

### Original Features
- Stacked based bytecode VM with the basic OPCode support.
- On-demand Scanner, Pratt Parser and Single-Pass Compiler.
- Uniform runtime representation for Lox Value. 
- Basic Unary and Binary Expression/Operators.
- Support for global and local variables.
- If..Else and Switch condition Statement.
- While Loop, Break and Continue Statement.
- Functions and Closures with automatic upvalue capture.
- Mark and sweep Garbage Collector.
- Classes, Objects, Methods and `this` keyword.
- Single Inheritance and `super` keyword.
- Performance improvement with Faster hash table probing and Nan-Boxing.

### New Features
- Framework for creating native functions, methods and classes.
- Array/Dictionary Literals and square bracket notation for array/dictionary access.
- New Operators: Modulo(`%`), Range(`..`) and Nil Handling(`?.`, `??`, `?:`).
- Operator overloading to allow operators to be treated as method calls, thus can be used by user defined classes.
- Variadic Functions, Anonymous Functions(local return) and Lambda Expressions(nonlocal return).
- `Object` root class for every class in Lox, everything is an object, and every object has a class.
- Object ID and generic object map which enable inheritance for special build-in classes such as `String` and `Array`.
- Class methods in class declaration using `class` keyword, and trait declaration using `trait` keyword.
- Anonymous classes/traits similar to anonymous functions/lambda.
- Namespace as CLox's module system, allowing importing namespace and aliasing of imported classes, traits and functions.
- CLox Standard Library for packages `lang`, `util`, `collection`, `io` and `net` in bullt-in namespace `clox.std`.
- Raise exception with `throw` keyword, and exception handling with try/catch/finally statement.
- Interceptor methods which are invoked automatically when getting/setting properties, invoking methods or throwing exceptions.
- Generator functions/methods which can yield control back to the caller and resume at a later point of execution.
- Promise API with event loop provided by libuv library for non-blocking IO operations.
- Introduction of `async` and `await` keywords, which allows C#/JS style of concurrency.
- Customized Runtime configuration for CLox using clox.ini.
- Allow loading lox source files in lox script and another lox source file with `require` keyword.
- Cross-platform build with Cmake and package manager with vcpkg.

### Enhanced or Removed Features
- VM is no longer a global variable, allowing CLox VM to be embedded in other host applications.
- Parser is extended with look-ahead capability, with field next storing the next token. 
- Print statement removed, use native function `print` and `println` instead.
- Initializer method is renamed from `init` to `__init__` as an interceptor method.
- Separated integer values(`Int`) and floating point(`Float`) values from `Number`.
- Improved string concatenation, addition of string interpolation and UTF-8 strings.
- C style For Loop replaced with Python/Kotlin style for-in Loop.
- Introduction of keyword `extends` instead of using `<` operator for class inheritance.
- Global variables are scoped within the file it is declared, effectively becoming module variable.
- Function/Method parameters become immutable by default, but may be mutable with `var` keyword.
- Built-in and user defined classes/functions become immutable, and cannot be accidentally overwritten.
- Fix reentrancy problem with CLox, calling Lox closures in C API becomes possible.
- Most runtime errors in VM interpreter loop replaced with Exceptions that can be caught at runtime.
- Inline caching for VM optimization, as well as implementation of Shape(Hidden Class) for better instance variable representation.


## Roadmap

### CLox v1.1.0
- VM is no longer a global variable, allowing CLox VM to be embedded in other host applications.

- Variadic Functions, Anonymous Functions(local return) and Lambda Expressions(nonlocal return).
- Replace C style for loop by Kotlin style for-in loop for collection types.

- Function/Method parameters become immutable by default, but may be mutable with `var` keyword.
- Built-in and user defined classes/functions become be immutable, and cannot be accidentally overwritten. 
- New class `Range` in package `collection`, as well as range operator(`..`) for range literals. 

### CLox 1.5.0

## FAQ

#### What is the purpose of this project?
CLox is an implementation of Lox language with bytecode VM instead of treewalk interpreter. It is the last experiment on feature implementations, before I will begin writing my own programming language `Mysidia` in C.

#### What will happen to KtLox?
Nothing, KtLox development is on hold until I can figure out a way to generate JVM bytecode instead of running the interpreter by walking down the AST. Treewalk interpreters are way too slow to be practical without JIT.
